# Tarot Solitaire

A variation of Klondike using a standard 78-card tarot pack. Created in JavaScript and displayed using HTML5 and CSS

## Getting Started

Download and fire up the index.html file in the folder, and Tarot Solitaire should run either locally or on a web server.

### Prerequisites

This project should run properly in any modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. 

### Running

To include the game in any web page, simply include all the .js files, the included stylesheet, and run the tarotsolitaire() function where you want it to appear. Here the minimum code needed to display the project:

```
<html><head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="tarotdeck.js"></script>
<script src="tarottable.js"></script>
<script src="tarotsolitaire.js"></script>
</head><body>
<script> tarotsolitaire();</script>
</body></html>
```

That's it!
